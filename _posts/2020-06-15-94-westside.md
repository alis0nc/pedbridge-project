Last Saturday (6 June), I re-attempted [24 May's ride] on a morning with more 
pleasant weather. I completed it this time and didn't bother to re-photograph 
the Roosevelt Avenue bridge, 
which makes **Tarn贸w Street** the first bridge documented on this ride. 
I believe the street is named for the [Polish city], since it's next to 
Chopin Street which is most likely named for the [Polish composer]. 
Detroit has a long history of Polish immigration, and there's even a 
[West Side Detroit Polish American Historical Society].

The next bridge west is **Lumley Street**, whose south end connects to the 
parking lot of Kay Beauty Supply.

The westernmost pedestrian bridge across I-94 in Detroit is **Trenton Street**, 
which links a residential street with businesses on Michigan Avenue and 
[Universal Academy] further south down Trenton Street.
