I really don't have an excuse for delaying this post so long, considering I 
rode across all the pedestrian bridges in Hazel Park *ten days ago* on 
the morning of 12 June. My route started at [my partner]'s house, which is 
only a couple blocks from Hazel Park's [Green Acres Park] and 
[Invest Roosevelt High School]. The **Browning Avenue** pedestrian bridge, 
the northernmost in Hazel Park, connects that park and school with the 
neighbourhood across I-75 to its east.

The next bridge to the south is **Orchard Avenue**, whose eastern end is 
in the parking lot of [Hazelcrest Place Apartments].

The next bridge, **Highland Avenue**, is on the south side of 9 Mile Road, 
i.e. less than a mile 
of straight north-south distance to the Detroit city limits. The barriers 
in front of bridge ramps that block vehicle access to them (and also block 
desirepaths) get a lot stronger on this side of 9 Mile. Coincidence? You 
decide. Also, I apparently forgot to take photos of the view down I-75 
from each side of the bridge.

The new **Harry Avenue** bridge is currently under construction. This replaces 
a bridge that was in service up to at least 2018, according to Street View imagery. The old bridge looks very similar to Hazel Park's other pedbridges, 
so I'm guessing the rest of them will be demolished and replaced ere long.

I hope the new Harry bridge is finished by September, since 
[United Oaks Elementary] lies at its east end.

The southernmost pedbridge in Hazel Park is **Bernhard Avenue**, which is 
five blocks north of 8 Mile Road.

**Addendum**: I was curious about who *Jynx* was. Armed with nothing but a 
date of birth, date of death, and the vague hunch that they lived, died, or 
were buried in Michigan, I was able to find this [Find A Grave entry]. 
Jynx's full name was *Amanda Rose Roeske*, and she's buried in [Hiawatha Cemetery]
in the Upper Peninsula. May her memory be a blessing.
