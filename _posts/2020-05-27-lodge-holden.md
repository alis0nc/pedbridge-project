This morning, I had to go to [Henry Ford Hospital](https://www.henryford.com/locations/henry-ford-hospital)
to have blood work done, a Post Office to drop off a couple packages, and 
[Whole Foods Market](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/detroit) to blow 
like $70 in gift cards on food and nice body care supplies I wouldn't otherwise be 
able to afford. I was finished at the hospital around 8:40 and had a few minutes 
to kill before the Post Office on Milwaukee opened at 9:00, so I was able to 
detour a bit, pass a townhouse complex named for [the real McCoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_McCoy), 
and cross a pedbridge in an area that's quite secluded considering 
its proximity to New Center, Midtown, and Henry Ford Hospital.
