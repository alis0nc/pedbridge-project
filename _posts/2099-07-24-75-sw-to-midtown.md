This post is a compilation of all the extant pedestrian bridges across I-75
from Ferdinand Street in Southwest Detroit, to Leland Street in Midtown/Forest Park.
There used to be several more south of Ferdinand, but they're either barricaded
(Northampton Street, by the Marathon refinery) or completely demolished due to 
I-75 and [Gordie Howe International Bridge] construction. Similarly to the 
[Lower Lodge] post, I didn't necessarily ride these bridges in order so I will 
present them from south to north.
