This post is a compilation of all the pedestrian bridges across the Lodge 
Freeway from downtown to Wayne State University/I-94, plus the Trumbull Crossing 
bridge across I-94 because its southern end is on the WSU athletic campus. I 
didn't necessarily ride these bridges in order, so I'm going to present them 
from south to north (up from downtown).
