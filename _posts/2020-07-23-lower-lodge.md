This post is a compilation of all the pedestrian bridges across the Lodge 
Freeway from downtown to Wayne State University/I-94, plus the Trumbull Crossing 
bridge across I-94 because its southern end is on the WSU athletic campus. I 
didn't necessarily ride these bridges in order or on the same day, so I'm 
going to present them from south to north (up from downtown).

<!-- fold -->

The southernmost bridge across the Lodge is also the only covered bridge. 
It connects the [municipal parking deck] at **900 West Jefferson Avenue** with 
the rear of the **[TCF Center]**. This has been my favourite pedbridge in Detroit
for a while, since the cylindrical shape with porthole windows makes it look 
like an airplane or a space station. 

The TCF Center is obviously closed due to the 
covid-19 pandemic, and I didn't attempt to enter the 900 West Jefferson deck 
(which is open *Special Events and Holidays as needed* according to its website; 
I don't think Sunday 12 July 2020 counted as either), so the best I can do is a 
few shots from afar.

The next bridge to the north is **Fort Street Plaza**, an overpass park on the
Wayne County Community College District [Downtown campus]. (It's my opinion 
that overpass parks count as pedbridges. They're structures crossing a freeway 
upon which vehicular traffic is forbidden. If this were the Suburban Pedbridge 
Project, I'd consider [Oak Park's pedestrian plazas] over I-696 fair game.)
The Plaza includes a stepped amphitheatre area and a grassy area, and there 
was formerly a more traditional pedbridge over the Lodge just south of it.
According to historical Street View imagery, that bridge was demolished sometime 
between July 2016 and August 2018.

The **Porter Street** bridge is tucked in between [Most Holy Trinity Parish] 
on [Corktown]'s eastern border and the ~~Pig Farm~~ 
[Detroit Public Safety Headquarters]. I'm always a little uneasy riding across
it, since my usual route involves going east across the bridge and a bit of wrong-way 
sidewalk riding up the Lodge Service Drive and Howard Street to get downtown. 
I'm afraid that a DPD cop or federal security officer with nothing better to do 
will harass me for that [perfectly legal] biking manoeuvre.

Speaking of [MotorCity Casino Hotel], that's very near the **Spruce Street** bridge, 
which connects MCCH's surface lots to a small warehouse district along 
Grand River Avenue and Fifth Street.

The next bridge up the Lodge is **Selden Street**, which connects the 
[Woodbridge Estates] apartment and condo community with the [Cass Corridor]/[Midtown]
commercial districts and the under-construction [Midtown West] condo building.
The neighborhood streets in Woodbridge Estates are all 
named after Motown musicians and music groups, e.g. Miracles Drive, Temptations 
Drive, and Contours Lane.

**Canfield Avenue** is the northern border of Woodbridge Estates, and also 
connects the [Calumet Townhomes] with [William Clay Ford Field]
and the former [GEE Edmonson Academy] and [Detroit Day School for the Deaf].

The two northernmost bridges of this post both have one end in the 
[Wayne State University] [Athletic Campus]. The more southerly of the two is 
signed as **Merrick Street**, though I just think of it as the *WSU Athletics*
pedbridge. It's very Wayne State-themed.

The other WSU Athletic Campus pedbridge, and the last one on today's tour, isn't 
actually across the Lodge. It's the **Brooklyn Avenue** (signed)/**Trumbull Crossing**
(what I think of it as) bridge across I-94, which links the [Trumbull Crossing] highrise with 
[Adams Field], WSU's football stadium.
