        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Back on the early morning of 25 September, <a href="https://twitter.com/ShadowFoxNixill">Nixill</a> messaged me a photo that they’d 
just taken. They’d ridden their bike up to the location of an interesting pedestrian 
bridge. It spans the intersection of Groesbeck Highway and Masonic (13½ Mile Road) 
in the northeastern suburb of Fraser, in the middle of an industrial district 
spanning both sides of Groesbeck. The closest residential area is about 500 feet 
to the east, and the closest schools are <a href="https://artsacad.net/">Arts Academy in the Woods</a> and 
<a href="https://www.fraser.k12.mi.us/Emerson">Emerson Elementary</a> over half a mile to the west.</p>

<p>In 2017, the Michigan Department of Transportation <a href="https://www.macombdaily.com/news/nation-world-news/pedestrian-bridge-over-groesbeck-in-fraser-to-stay/article_a1ee2577-742e-50d6-8080-4a87fda4c1ec.html">considered demolishing the bridge</a>, 
citing its age and lack of ADA compliance. (It’s one of only a few extant local pedbridges I 
can think of that has stairs, rather than some sort of ramp.) Fraser City Council 
members acknowledged that it isn’t heavily trafficked, but said it’s in good condition and 
provides an important alternative to crossing the seven-lane Groesbeck Highway at-grade, 
so the bridge stayed.</p>

          <p>This post is a compilation of all the extant pedestrian bridges across I-75
in <a href="https://visitdetroit.com/southwest-detroit-neighborhood/">Southwest Detroit</a>. Similarly to the <a href="/pedbridge-project/m10/i94/lower-lodge/">Lower Lodge</a> post, I didn’t necessarily ride 
these bridges in order or on the same day, so I will present them from south

<p>I live in Southwest Detroit, so this post will be a bit more opinionated 
and text-heavy than most of my other posts.</p>

          <p><strong>Update 2020-07-22</strong>: Added dashcam frame grabs illustrating the recent
developments in Hazel Park.</p>

<p>This past Thursday I was driving down I-75 on the way back from <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/site/stores/madison-heights.aspx">Micro Center</a>.
I discovered that the bridgescapes in Hazel Park have changed significantly since 
<a href="/pedbridge-project/i75/bonus-hazel-park/">my last post</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s now a sound-isolating wall between the freeway and Hazelcrest Place 
apartments, near the <strong>Orchard Avenue</strong> bridge.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Harry Avenue</strong> new pedbridge is open to the public, even as it still 
has some scaffolding on its outside.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Bernhard Avenue</strong> old pedbridge has been demolished (and with it, the 
memorial to Jynx), and work has begun on its replacement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to take new photos on Thursday. On 2020-07-22, 
I was passing through the area again and this time I remembered to take the SD 
card out of my dashcam and take some frame grabs, which are below.</p>

<p>Also, sorry for the lack of updates. I’ve been busy with things like helping a 
friend clean out his house, job interviews, and lamenting the recent heat wave 
in Detroit. I documented all the bridges along the Lodge south of I-94 this past 
Tuesday, and I’m going to document all the bridges along I-75 between Ferdinand
(the southernmost currently open bridge) and Leland (in Midtown) tomorrow morning.</p>

          <p><strong>Update 2020-07-22</strong>: See <a href="/pedbridge-project/i75/hazel-park-update/">Hazel Park updates</a> for the state of Hazel Park’s pedbridges
as of late July 2020.</p>

<p>I really don’t have an excuse for delaying this post so long, considering I 
rode across all the pedestrian bridges in Hazel Park <em>ten days ago</em> on 
the morning of 12 June. My route started at <a href="https://twitter.com/fishsummitTV">my partner</a>’s house, which is 
only a couple blocks from Hazel Park’s <a href="http://oaklandcounty115.com/2018/10/24/explore-green-acres-park-in-hazel-park/">Green Acres Park</a> and 
<a href="https://www.hazelparkschools.org/schools/programs/invest-roosevelt-alternative-high-school/">Invest Roosevelt High School</a>. The <strong>Browning Avenue</strong> pedestrian bridge, 
the northernmost in Hazel Park, connects that park and school with the 
neighbourhood across I-75 to its east.</p>
